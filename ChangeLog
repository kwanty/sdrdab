=========================================
Software Defined Radio - DAB+ (libsdrdab)
=========================================

Version. 3.0, 2017-09-23
=============================
    - Remove custom RTL-SDR, now using system librtlsdr0
    - Refactoring fs and fc drift support (need more testing and tuning)
    - Support input RAW IQ files with formats: (u)int8, (u)int16, float, double, raw (uint8)
    - Custom resampler (RF IQ data) of type NN and Linear, code integrated as Resampler
    - Custom implementation of ReedSolomon decoder
    - Matlab model of various distortions (distort IQ samples for development purpose)
    - XPAD implementation, text only (need more development and integration)
    - Refactoring convolutional decoder subsystem, ready for different implementation nad real-time switching
    - Initial implementation of spiral convolutional decoder
    - Fix MPEG2 support (classic DAB)
    - Fix error in decoding EEP-B and EEP-A protection levels
    - Decode data from NULL
    - Acquire testing data
    - Generate mux testing data (DAB/DAB+, all protection levels, X-pad, etc...)
    - Improve synchronizer (cleaner, faster code)
    - Framework for extensive test of bitstream-level decoding for various mux configuration
    - Improve UnitTest for depuncturer (supports all combination)
    - Fix, improve and extend sdrdab-cli reference implementation
    - Fix synchronization audio player with data decoder (audio buffer is no longer overloaded)
    - Ubuntu package generator (need review and testing)

Version. 2.0, 2016-06-07
=============================
    - new Scheduler: faster, more stable, readable code
    - refactored DataDecoder
    - rewritten remodulation (fc): LUT-based
    - Viterbi optimization by means of SSE3 (up to 3x improvement)
    - refactored Synchronizer
    - support legacy DAB (MPEG) and DAB+ (AAC)
    - add two version of SNR calculation: from spectrum (RAW) and prefix
    - rewritten build system, now using cmake instead of Eclipse
    - MacOS X support
    - improved debug logging 
    - refactoring DataFeeder (need even more refactoring)
    - simple GUI implementation (need to be rewritten and improved)
    - acquired DAB+ signal for testing
    - upgraded sdrdab-cli (more parameters)
    - Matlab reference software for DAB(+) decoder
    - included unittest
    - MODE III still not supported    

Version. 1.0 BETA, 2015-07-07
=============================
    - x86, real-time implementation (i7-3520M: 20-100% CPU utilization depends on configuration)
    - decoding type: file2file, file2speaker, air2file, air2speaker
    - MODE I, MODE II, MODE IV (MODE III supported but buggy - do not works)
    - input devices: all tuners supported by sdrlib (tested on RLT2832U + R820T, R820T2)
    - input file: biarny, 8 bits per I/Q sample (unsigned int, 127 == 0), format: IQIQIQIQIQ...
    - change carrier frequency on air2* mode
    - fine tune carrier frequency (ppm)
    - 2.048 MHz base sampling frequency (resampling if necessary in file2* mode)
    - decode station list with names
    - switch between station in real-time
    - DAB+ (AAC) without XPAD, only audio (old DAB MPEG supported but buggy - do not works)
