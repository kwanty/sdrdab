TAKE CARE:
ImageMagick and Ubuntu 16.04
----------------------------
Please note that Ubuntu 16.04 still (09.03.2017) ships a version of ImageMagick
that was affected by a memory leak (see #2). Hence ODR-PadEnc will increasingly
consume memory until it crashes!

Until Ubuntu backports the bugfix, you should therefore use a more recent
version of ImageMagick (6.9.2-2 or higher).
