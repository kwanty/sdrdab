=========================================
Software Defined Radio - DAB+ (libsdrdab)
=========================================

Version. 2.0, 2016-06-07
=============================
    - new Scheduler: faster, more stable, readable code
    - refactored DataDecoder
    - rewritten remodulation (fc): make use of LUT
    - Viterbi optimization by means of SSE3 (up to 3x improvement)
    - refactored Synchronizer
    - support legacy DAB (MPEG) and DAB+ (AAC)
    - added two versions of SNR calculation: from spectrum (RAW) and prefix
    - rewritten build system, now using cmake instead of Eclipse
    - MacOS X support
    - improved debug logging 
    - refactored DataFeeder (needs even more refactoring)
    - simple GUI implementation (needs to be rewritten and improved)
    - acquired DAB+ signal for testing
    - upgraded sdrdab-cli (more parameters)
    - Matlab reference software for DAB(+) decoder
    - included UnitTests
    - MODE III still not supported    

Version. 1.0 BETA, 2015-07-07
=============================
    - x86, real-time implementation (i7-3520M: 20-100% CPU utilization depending on configuration)
    - decoding type: file2file, file2speaker, air2file, air2speaker
    - MODE I, MODE II, MODE IV (MODE III supported but buggy - does not works)
    - input devices: all tuners supported by rtlsdr (tested on RLT2832U + R820T, R820T2)
    - input file: biarny, 8 bits per I/Q sample (unsigned int, 127 == 0), format: IQIQIQIQIQ...
    - change carrier frequency on air2* mode
    - fine tune carrier frequency (ppm)
    - 2.048 MHz base sampling frequency (resampling if necessary in file2* mode)
    - decode station list with names
    - switch between stations in real-time
    - DAB+ (AAC) without XPAD, only audio (old DAB MPEG supported but buggy - does not works)
