1. ui_mainwindow.h should be autogenerated during build. In theory that's
already implemented via CMAKE_AUTOUIC in CMakeLists.txt, but it doesn't work
correctly due to a bug in CMake 2.8.12.2 (which is included in Ubuntu 14.04 as
of 16 Sep 2016). ui_mainwindow.h should probably be removed from here as soon
as we stop supporting Ubuntu 14.04 and CMake older than 3.1
