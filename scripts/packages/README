TOOL:
This script (make_deb.sh) is used to create debian package out of compiled binaries/libraries, meta-data and extra files.

OPTIONS:
--config FILE - Point file from which setup variable are being read.
    Script is bundled with template config file named config_template.source
--root PATH - Point path to use assign as PROJECT_ROOT.
    This variable can used to specify setup variables more dynamically.
    By default PROJECT_ROOT is current directory.
--clean, --prepare, --create, --test - these flags are described in STEPS section below.
--default - Combines flags: --clean, --prepare, --create
--dynamic_dependencies - List dynamic package dependencies (description in DEPENDENCIES section).
--help - Print this document and exit

STEPS:
Note: Options listed with steps are the ones,
    that need to be provided during invocation for this step to execute.

* Parsing input options
* Loading config file if specified (option: --config)
* Cleaning directory used for packaging (options: --clean, --default)
* Preparing directory structure, copying files, creating meta-files for package (options: --prepare, --default)
* Creating debian package (options: --create, --default)
* Testing package for issues (option: --test)


DEPENDENCIES:
Script can also generate dependencies for binaries in package by passing --dynamic_dependencies flag.
Packages selected as dependencies are always the first one found by apt-file for each linked library.
It may choose non-optimal packages as dependencies, as well as duplicate entries.

SETUP VARIABLES - FILES AND DIRECTORIES:


PROJECT_ROOT - variable used to simplify dir organisation.
    It is not used directly in script, but can be helpful to define other setup variables.

PACKAGE_DIR - directory to populate with package-related files
CONTROL_DIR - pointer to DEBIAN directory inside PACKAGE_DIR, used for storing meta-files
RESULT_DIR - directory, where created package will be placed into

EXTRA_DATA_DIR - directory containing extra files for package like manual, copyright, etc.

MATCH_BINARIES - directory/file/glob containing bianries to be included in package
MOVE_BINARIES - path for binaries to be installed in system, must be relative to PACKAGE_ROOT

MATCH_LIBRARIES, MOVE_LIBRARIES - as above, but related to shared libraries, currently unused

MATCH_DOCS - path to file containing uncompressed manual for binary
MOVE_DOCS - path for manual to be moved in system, must be relative to PACKAGE_ROOT

MATCH_COPYRIGHT, MOVE_COPYRIGHT - as above, but related to copyright file

PREINST_SCRIPT, POSTRM_SCRIPT - path to preinst, postrm maintainer scripts

SETUP VARIABLES - META DATA:

CTL_PACKAGE, CTL_VERSION, CTL_PRIORITY, CTL_SECTION, CTL_MAINTAINER,
CTL_ARCHITECTURE, CTL_HOMEPAGE, CTL_DEPENDS, CTL_DESCRIPTION:
    These variables correspond to appropriate fields in DEBIAN/control file.
    For more information manual pages for
    deb-control and deb-version shoud be checked.

CTL_LONG_DESCRIPTION_FILE - as above, however variable does not store text of long description,
    but points to file containing it.
